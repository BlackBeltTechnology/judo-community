# What is low-code?

Simply put, low-code development is a paradigm that uses models as the primary artifact of the development process, and
the implementation is (semi-)automatically generated from the models.

# Target audience

JUDO is designed for software developers who want to speed up their work and focus on business needs instead of typing
architectural glue code and copying design patterns.

# Getting started
