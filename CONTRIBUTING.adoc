## Installing the correct versions of Java, Maven and necessary dependencies

JUDO is currently built on top of JDK 11.

Contributors, and CI/CD agents are bot expected to use https://www.azul.com/downloads/?version=java-11-lts&package=jdk[Zulu JDK]

Dependency management is handled by https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[Maven v3.8.x]

To check if you are using the correct version of Java, you may run `java -version`, which should display something similar:

```
openjdk version "11.0.14" 2022-01-18 LTS
OpenJDK Runtime Environment Zulu11.54+23-CA (build 11.0.14+9-LTS)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Zulu11.54+23-CA (build 11.0.14+9-LTS, mixed mode)
```

Checking Maven version is done via running `mvn -version`, which should display something similar to:

```
Apache Maven 3.8.4 (9b656c72d54e5bacbed989b64718c159fe39b537)
Maven home: /opt/homebrew/Cellar/maven/3.8.4/libexec
```

Once you have done that, to get started with the repo simply run:

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:BlackBeltTechnology/judo-community.git
mvn clean install
```

## Code Structure

Most of the folders (or Maven submodules) are linked via git, therefore have standalone lifecycles. Working on a feature,
or fix could result in working in multiple modules.

## Submission Guidelines

### <a name="submit-issue"></a> Submitting an Issue

Before you submit an issue, please search the issue tracker. An issue for your problem may already exist and has been
resolved, or the discussion might inform you of workarounds readily available.

We want to fix all the issues as soon as possible, but before fixing a bug we need to reproduce and confirm it. Having a
reproducible scenario gives us wealth of important information without going back and forth with you requiring
additional information, such as:

- the output of `java -version`, `mvn -version`
- `pom.xml` or `.flattened-pom.xml`
- and most importantly - a use-case that fails

A minimal reproduction allows us to quickly confirm a bug (or point out a coding problem) as well as confirm that we are
fixing the right problem.

We will be insisting on a minimal reproduction in order to save maintainers' time and ultimately be able to fix more
bugs. We understand that sometimes it might be hard to extract essentials bits of code from a larger codebase, but we
really need to isolate the problem before we can fix it.

You can file new issues by filling out our [issue form](https://github.com/BlackBeltTechnology/judo-community/issues/new/choose).

### <a name="submit-pr"></a> Submitting a PR

This project follows [GitHub's standard forking model](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/). Please fork the
project to submit pull requests.

## Commands

The following commands are always ran against all submodules. If you are working on a dedicated module, then it could be
sufficient to run them in their corresponding folders!

### Run Tests

```sh
$ mvn clean test
```

### Run Full build

```sh
$ mvn clean install
```
