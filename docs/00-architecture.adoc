= Architecture

The following section describes what model transformation steps are involved in the generation of a typical JUDO application.

== Layers / acronyms

As described in the previous sections, JUDO builds on top of modeling, and generates code based on the result of the
transformation steps between different models.

=== PSM
Platform Specific Model.

In modeling terminology it is the physical representation of a logical model which contains platform specific
representations. The JUDO PSM model in the JUDO architectural view means the business model representation. The PSM
model contains `Classes`, `Operations`, `Attributes`, `Expressions` in JQL (JUDO Query Language) form, etc...

=== ASM
Architecture Specific Models.

It's a group of models which represent an architecture layer. These models are loaded into the JUDO runtime..

=== LSM

Layer Specific Models.

It's a group of models which are concrete technological representations. These models are loaded into the JUDO runtime.

== Diagrams

In this section we will showcase different diagrams from different aspects to help better understand what steps are
involved in the application generation.
